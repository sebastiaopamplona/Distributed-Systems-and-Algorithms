## Distributed Systems and Algorithms

This course is intended to consolidate the knowledge of students in the area of distributed systems. The course has a strong algorithmic component, with some formal exposition and analysis, while also including a strong connection to the practical realization of these algorithms and their use in the construction of practical systems. The course also provides an introduction to the techniques and algorithms that support the construction of large scale distributed systems which have become increasing relevant now-a-days.

## Project 1

Publish-subscribe using an unstructured overlay network, implemented in Scala. More info in ./project_1/project_specifications.pdf.

## Project 2

Simple key value store, where all replicas have the same information. The service itself provides two client operations to manipulate the key value store: read(Key) and write(key, value). Replication with Paxos, Implemented in Scala. More info in ./project_2/project_specifications.pdf.
